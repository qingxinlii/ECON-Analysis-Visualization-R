##### Writing: 

Since 2000, Germany's CO2 emission per capita was decreading constantly. Especially since 2015 the CO2 emission per capita had been decreasing at an increasing rate. This might be due to Germany's claim for the 65% of CO2 emission reduction by 2030.

Since 2000 to 2005, Spain's CO2 emission per capita had been increasing  largely, but after that it had been decreasing largely as well. Due to especially the COVID-19 pendemic, Spain's COâ‚‚ emissions dropped slightly as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. However after economic is having a recovery from the pendemic, Spain's CO2 emission per capita had a slightly trend of increasing their CO2 emission per capita significantly.
