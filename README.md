# ECON-Analysis-Visualization-R

This file analyzes Economic Data retrieved from:

    * WDI (World Development Indicators (World Bank)), 
    
    * Vancouver Police Department
    
    * ...


In each analysis, it includes:

    * a brief description of the research that I am interested investigating.
    
    * a visual presentation of trends shown in the dataset.
    
    * a summary analysis of the outcome found.


rProjects:

      1. DataVisual: Inflation Comparison between UK and France 1970-2020

      2. DataVisual: CO2 emission (per-capita) & GDP (per-capita) Comparison between Germany & Spain 2000-2020
      
      

Skills:   (These rProjects is intended to show my ability to complete work.)
         
         * data tidying:  clean large amount of messy data inputs --> into a file of organized variables and observations
         
         * data manipulation:  find a targeted group of data observations, create new variables of interest, etc
         
         * data visualization:  generate bar graph, scatter plot, line graph, etc. 
         
         * data analysis:  
               
               * declare trends and patterns found in dataset
               
               * find causal relationship between two variables of interest, using Regression designs:
                        
                        * Linear Regression
                        
                        * Multi-Linear Regression
                        
                        * Difference in difference 
               
               * do statistical analysis with summary statistics:
                        
                        * hypothesis testing
                        
                        * confidence interval
                        
                        * t-tests, p-value
