# ECON-Analysis-Visualization-R

This file analyzes Economic Data retrieved from:

    * WDI (World Development Indicators (World Bank)), 
    
    * Vancouver Police Department
    
    * ...


In each analysis, it includes:

    * a brief description of the research that I am interested investigating.
    
    * a visual presentation of trends shown in the dataset.
    
    * a summary analysis of the outcome found.


rProjects:

      1. [Inflation Comparison between UK and France 1970-2020](Economic-Analysis/DataVisualization_inflation UK France.Rmd)

      2. [CO2 emission & GDP Comparison between Germany & Spain 2000-2020](https://github.com/qingxinlii/ECON-Analysis-Visualization-R-/blob/634526d89649439a87f5b1a2618d4c19fb7a2e97/DataVisualization_inflation%20UK%20France.Rmd)
      
      3. [Vancouver Crime Analysis](https://github.com/qingxinlii/ECON-Analysis-Visualization-R-/blob/634526d89649439a87f5b1a2618d4c19fb7a2e97/DataVisualization_Vancouver%20Crime%20on%20October%205th%202021.Rmd)

Skills:   (These rProjects is intended to show my ability to complete work.)
         
         * data tidying:  clean large amount of messy data inputs --> into a file of organized variables and observations
         
         * data manipulation:  find a targeted group of data observations, create new variables of interest, etc
         
         * data visualization:  generate bar graph, scatter plot, line graph, etc. 
         
         * data analysis:  
               
               * declare trends and patterns found in dataset
               
               * find causal relationship between two variables of interest, using Regression designs:
                        
                        * Linear Regression
                        
                        * Multi-Linear Regression
                        
                        * Difference in difference 
               
               * do statistical analysis with summary statistics:
                        
                        * hypothesis testing
                        
                        * confidence interval
                        
                        * t-tests, p-value
